# Case 014-misclassified-door: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1203 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–2 of 16 (events 3–16 withheld)
- `history.md` (1,283 bytes, 1,279 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–2 of 16 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Overview, Outcome, Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Intake classified as Appliances/fridge; the tenant's words describe a door fault. Trusted the tenant's words.

## Assumptions
- Tenant contact is the existing thread, as no direct details are on file
- The ticket severity field could not be changed directly, so urgency is recorded in the ticket note

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** I should update the ticket's category to locks/door, though I can't directly change severity via the update tool so I'll note that it needs urgent attention. I also need to ask the tenant some safety-related questions, request landlord approval for our contractor, and since there's no tenant contact on file, I'll reference the existing thread from event 001. Now let me proceed with the calls.
