# Case 024-gas-smell-in-routine-report: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1188 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–6 of 6 (the full history)
- `history.md` (1,822 bytes, 1,810 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–6 of 6 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `checks.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- The tenant calls the gas smell 'not urgent', but any gas smell is treated as an emergency under policy.

## Assumptions
- The tenant can read email and may not see it immediately, so a phone call is recommended.

## Trace
1. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** A gas smell is a genuine emergency — I need to tell the tenant to leave immediately, avoid switches or flames, and call the gas emergency line, while escalating this as P1. I should create an emergency ticket linked to the relevant reference, so I'll pull up the ticket list first to get that ref.
