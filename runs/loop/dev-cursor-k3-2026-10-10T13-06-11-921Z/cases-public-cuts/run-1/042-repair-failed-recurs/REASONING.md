# Case 042-repair-failed-recurs: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1354 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–32 of 32 (the full history)
- `history.md` (11,905 bytes, 11,827 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–32 of 32 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Invoice £75.11 (event 024) vs £75 + VAT in the landlord update (event 025). Not resolved.
- The event 024 invoice due date reads 2026, an apparent anomaly.
- The ticket was closed with no tenant or landlord confirmation, and the landlord message of event 025 was only an update.

## Assumptions
- Lantern Services is the provider who did the original repair and is responsible for the guarantee.
- The workmanship guarantee applies to this fault.

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** Since this is a recurring issue, policy says to reopen the ticket under the workmanship guarantee with the same provider rather than closing it or creating a new chargeable job, and I need to notify the landlord. I'll update the ticket, confirm Lantern Services as contractor given landlord approval, and ask them to confirm a return visit date, then message the contractor, tenant, and landlord accordingly.
