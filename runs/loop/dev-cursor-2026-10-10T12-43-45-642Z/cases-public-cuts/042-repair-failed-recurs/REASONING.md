# Case 042-repair-failed-recurs: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1354 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–32 of 32 (the full history)
- `history.md` (11,905 bytes, 11,827 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–32 of 32 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Ticket closed at event 031 with 'Need confirmation from landlord' and no tenant confirmation; the tenant's later report shows the repair failed. Trusted the tenant.
- The visit slot recorded on 23/02 conflicts with the tenant call about Tuesday 1pm; the repair is reported as done anyway.
- Invoice due date of July 2026 (event 024) is odd.

## Assumptions
- Same provider returns, as the landlord's approval for an engineer stands.
- Landlord addressed as Mercer per event 004.

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** Since the ticket was closed but the fix failed, I need to reopen it and request a return visit from the provider, since landlord approval already exists. I'll update the ticket stage, message the provider for a follow-up visit, and keep the tenant and landlord informed.
