## Trace
1. **Tool call** `get_ticket` {"ref":"037"}
   - ⚠️ `get_ticket` result: {"ok":false,"error":"not_found"}
2. **Tool call** `list_tickets` {}
   - `list_tickets` result: {"ok":true,"tickets":[{"ref":"NBL-037-landlord-thumbs-up","stage":"init","property":"Flat 14, 44 Lantern Quay, Alderwick, ZZ9 8ZZ","description":"Shower cable leading to the shower handle is damaged and leaking. \nPlease replace"}]}
3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** A thumbs up is too ambiguous given the landlord's two-option question, so I'll log it as unclear and follow up with a direct yes/no. I'll also note the possibility the leak is near the shower hose rather than electrical, keep the request on hold with a review date, and update the tenant on the status.
