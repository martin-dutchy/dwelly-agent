# Case 019-landlord-own-contractor: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1595 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–18 of 44 (events 19–44 withheld)
- `history.md` (5,139 bytes, 5,094 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–18 of 44 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Overview, Outcome, Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Event 009 says the landlord approved the quote, but events 010-017 say we are still waiting for the landlord. I trusted the later holds, because no landlord words are on record.

## Assumptions
- The landlord record holds a usable mobile number.

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** The landlord stayed silent, and that note about approving the £500+VAT quote isn't actually the landlord's own words, so I can't treat it as a real decision given the conflicting holds. I'll send the landlord an SMS with a clear yes/no question and deadline, update the tenant by email, then put the case on hold with a review date and log a note.
