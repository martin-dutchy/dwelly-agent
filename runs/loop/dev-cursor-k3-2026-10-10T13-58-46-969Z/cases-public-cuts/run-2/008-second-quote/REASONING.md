# Case 008-second-quote: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1268 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–9 of 49 (events 10–49 withheld)
- `history.md` (2,668 bytes, 2,650 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–9 of 49 from history.md
- `attachments/attachment-01-check-out-inspection-report.pdf` (213,515 bytes, 16,887 chars parsed): PDF text layer extracted with pdftotext
- `attachments/attachment-02-estimate.pdf` (74,406 bytes, 1,779 chars parsed): PDF text layer extracted with pdftotext
- `attachments/attachment-03-check-out-inspection-report.pdf` (129,002 bytes, 13,391 chars parsed): PDF text layer extracted with pdftotext
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Overview, Outcome, Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `attachments/attachment-04-invoice.pdf`: first linked from an event after the decision point
- `checks.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Estimate leaves the carpet while the request asked to replace it; it replaces the tap where the request said repair
- Inspection report dated 5 Jan 2026 but signed 3 Apr 2025
- Event 006 attached the inspection report twice, not the estimate

## Assumptions
- Property is vacant, so there is no tenant to message

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** No other contractor is named, so I'll move forward with the double quotation, notify the landlord, and hold. The property doesn't appear tenanted so there's no tenant correspondence to consider. The first quote is from Alder Compliance at £1,370 with no VAT itemised, and I noticed attachment 02 wasn't included in the landlord email while attachment 03 appears twice — worth flagging, but the quote itself looks fine to record.
