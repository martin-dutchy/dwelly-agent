# Case 13: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case brief (689 chars)
- `inputs/compliance.json` (457 bytes, 457 chars parsed): read as text
- `inputs/crm.json` (845 bytes, 845 chars parsed): read as text
- `inputs/emails_access.txt` (403 bytes, 403 chars parsed): read as text
- `inputs/legacy_notes.csv` (180 bytes, 180 chars parsed): read as text

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `checks.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent
- `tool_failures.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Legacy note says cert renewed 2025 all good; consistent with compliance.json but undated, so the compliance record was used.
- get_property returned not found; relied on case inputs.

## Assumptions
- Gas check cost is within the £300 spend limit
- Tenant is occupying (CRM shows tenant on P-230)

## Trace
1. **Tool call** `get_property` {"property":"P-230"}
   - ⚠️ `get_property` result: {"ok":false,"error":"not_found","say":"No property record: rely on the case inputs."}
2. **Tool call** `list_tickets` {}
   - `list_tickets` result: {"ok":true,"tickets":[]}
3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** There are no existing tickets, so I need to create one and assign HeatRight, scheduling a window at least 24 hours out and before 16 Oct. Since today is Saturday 10 Oct, Tuesday 13 Oct 09:00-13:00 works well for the notice period, and the spend limit of 300 should comfortably cover a typical gas check, so I'll proceed with the assignment.
