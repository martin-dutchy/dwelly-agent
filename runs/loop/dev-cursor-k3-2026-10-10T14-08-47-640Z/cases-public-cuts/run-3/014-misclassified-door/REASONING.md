# Case 014-misclassified-door: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1203 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–2 of 16 (events 3–16 withheld)
- `history.md` (1,283 bytes, 1,279 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–2 of 16 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Overview, Outcome, Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Intake classified as Appliances/routine; tenant's words describe a door fault. Trusted the tenant's words.

## Assumptions
- Tenant is reachable on the existing thread
- Severity urgent pending answer on whether the door secures

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** I should reclassify this as a security-severity issue by updating the ticket with a note, since update_ticket doesn't have a dedicated severity field. I also need to ask the tenant some safety-related questions and confirm whether the unit is secure, plus check on landlord approval, replying within the existing thread rather than creating a new ticket.
