The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Estimate omits carpet replacement and includes tap replacement, against the original request
- Inspection report dated Jan 2026 but signed April 2025

## Assumptions
- Landlord's 'one other subcontractor' means a quote for the same scope

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** Since no other contractor is named, I'll update the ticket status to double_quotation, notify the landlord, add a note, and place it on hold. I should also record the first quote—£1,370 from Alder Compliance with no VAT itemised—since recording it seems reasonable here.
