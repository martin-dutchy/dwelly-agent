# Case 008-second-quote: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1268 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–9 of 49 (events 10–49 withheld)
- `history.md` (2,668 bytes, 2,650 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–9 of 49 from history.md
- `attachments/attachment-01-check-out-inspection-report.pdf` (213,515 bytes, 16,887 chars parsed): PDF text layer extracted with pdftotext
- `attachments/attachment-02-estimate.pdf` (74,406 bytes, 1,779 chars parsed): PDF text layer extracted with pdftotext
- `attachments/attachment-03-check-out-inspection-report.pdf` (129,002 bytes, 13,391 chars parsed): PDF text layer extracted with pdftotext
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Overview, Outcome, Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `attachments/attachment-04-invoice.pdf`: first linked from an event after the decision point
- `checks.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Alder estimate leaves the bedroom carpet and replaces the tap, against the original request
- Inspection reports dated 5 Jan 2026 but signed April 2025
- Report notes burn damage as pre-existing, while the request treats it as new damage
- Hint says provider visit not booked; the job is at the quote stage

## Assumptions
- Landlord's 'Morning' email is a reply to event 006
- Property is void after checkout, so no tenant message

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** Since the landlord wants a second quote and no other contractor is named, I should update the ticket to double_quotation status, inform the landlord, add a note, and hold with a review date—there's no tenant message needed since the property appears void. I also notice the first quote from Alder Compliance (£1,370) is attached but hasn't been recorded yet, so I should record that quote as well.
