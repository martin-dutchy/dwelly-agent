# Case 001-landlord-pays-direct: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1217 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–42 of 44 (events 43–44 withheld)
- `history.md` (11,280 bytes, 11,190 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–42 of 44 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: `attachment-44-document`, `attachment-17-document`

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Overview, Outcome, Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `checks.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Event 035 'provider assigned' vs landlord using own contractor: treated the landlord route as current.
- Event 036 'no tenant contact needed' vs earlier promises to update tenants: tenant updated anyway.
- Landlord names vary across emails (Rowan, Felix, Leo, Harper): treated as the same landlord thread.

## Assumptions
- Freya at Riverside Services is the landlord's own contractor and the same person as on the 11 Dec call.

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** This is the landlord's own contractor, who gets paid directly. The 11 Dec call covered tree removal, invoicing, and completion but lacks detail, and completion isn't confirmed by evidence. I'll record the decision as own_contractor, citing the landlord's quote about asking Freya to confirm start and giving the go-ahead, then follow up to confirm work completion and direct payment before notifying the tenant — this shouldn't be closed yet.
