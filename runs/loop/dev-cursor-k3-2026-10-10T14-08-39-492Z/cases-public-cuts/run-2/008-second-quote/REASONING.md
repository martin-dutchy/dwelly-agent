# Case 008-second-quote: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1268 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–9 of 49 (events 10–49 withheld)
- `history.md` (2,668 bytes, 2,650 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–9 of 49 from history.md
- `attachments/attachment-01-check-out-inspection-report.pdf` (213,515 bytes, 16,887 chars parsed): PDF text layer extracted with pdftotext
- `attachments/attachment-02-estimate.pdf` (74,406 bytes, 1,779 chars parsed): PDF text layer extracted with pdftotext
- `attachments/attachment-03-check-out-inspection-report.pdf` (129,002 bytes, 13,391 chars parsed): PDF text layer extracted with pdftotext
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Overview, Outcome, Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `attachments/attachment-04-invoice.pdf`: first linked from an event after the decision point
- `checks.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Inspection report dated 5 January 2026 but signed 3 April 2025 (after today); estimate says carpet can stay despite request to replace it; estimate replaces tap although tap only dripping
- Landlord email says 'Morning' but sent 19:37

## Assumptions
- Property is void after tenant vacated, so no tenant message
- Estimate treated as £1,370 with VAT not itemised

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** Since no other contractor is named, I'll update the ticket status to double_quotation and send an internal message. I should record the Alder Compliance estimate of £1,370 from attachment-02, and since the property is void there's no need for tenant messaging—just an internal note back to the agency manager who raised it.
