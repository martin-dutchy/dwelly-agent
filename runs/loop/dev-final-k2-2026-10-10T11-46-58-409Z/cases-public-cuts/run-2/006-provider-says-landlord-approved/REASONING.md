# Case 006-provider-says-landlord-approved: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1168 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–15 of 15 (the full history)
- `history.md` (5604 chars)
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

## Conflicts between sources
- Provider says the landlord approved by phone; the record shows no landlord reply, so I trusted the record.
- The landlord is named Oscar in event 013 and Ruben in event 014.

## Assumptions
- The £605 total is the sum of the four quoted lines
- The flat is void, as the tenant has vacated
