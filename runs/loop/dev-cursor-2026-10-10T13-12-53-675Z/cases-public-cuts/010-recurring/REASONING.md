# Case 010-recurring: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1126 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–15 of 15 (the full history)
- `history.md` (2,843 bytes, 2,813 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–15 of 15 from history.md
- `attachments/attachment-01-photograph-of-a-solar-photovoltaic-generation-me.pdf` (73,851 bytes, 987 chars parsed): PDF text layer extracted with pdftotext
- Referenced in the history but not provided: `attachment-80-document`

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Overview, Outcome, Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Original request said next due mid June; landlord's latest statement says 15 September, which I treated as current.
- Tenant email event 012 contained only a signature, yet a photo was forwarded; I relied on the attachment on file.

## Assumptions
- Landlord Ava is the landlord of this property, as the thread is already on the case.

## Trace
1. **Tool call** `list_tickets` {}
