# Case 042-repair-failed-recurs: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1354 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–32 of 32 (the full history)
- `history.md` (11,905 bytes, 11,827 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–32 of 32 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Event 031 closed the job although event 030 said landlord confirmation was needed and the tenant never confirmed; tenant's latest report (event 032) trusted.
- Invoice amount £75.11 (event 024) versus £75 + VAT (event 025) not reconciled.

## Assumptions
- The recurrence is the same fault, so a recall under the existing landlord approval is reasonable with no new spend.

   - ⚠️ `get_ticket` result: {"ok":false,"error":"not_found"}
3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** The ticket's already closed, so since this is a recurrence of the same issue I should reopen it with the provider and loop in the landlord. Since the landlord already approved an engineer visit before, a return visit for the same fault should fall under that same approval, but I should still check in with them.

5. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** I should reopen the ticket and update its stage with a note, then notify the provider, tenant, and landlord. Since this is a warranty callback for a faulty repair rather than new work, I'll ask the original provider to return and fix it rather than assigning a new contractor or spend.
