# Case 037-landlord-thumbs-up: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1102 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–7 of 7 (the full history)
- `history.md` (1,965 bytes, 1,949 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–7 of 7 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `checks.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
_None identified._

## Assumptions
- Event 007 (thumbs-up) answers the event 003 question but doesn't say which option the landlord chose.

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** The record isn't clear on whether "cable" refers to an electric shower - I should ask a yes/no question to clarify, then advise the tenant on safety: if it is an electric shower, they should switch it off at the isolator.
