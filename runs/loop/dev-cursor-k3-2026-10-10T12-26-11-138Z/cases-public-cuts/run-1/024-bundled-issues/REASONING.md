# Case 024-bundled-issues: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1188 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–32 of 32 (the full history)
- `history.md` (8,242 bytes, 8,170 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–32 of 32 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Overview, Outcome, Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Event 016 said the oven was fixed, but the tenant said at event 006 that it never worked and there is no provider result on file.
- The landlord's 'yes please' (event 010) covered the oven only, not the roof or fence.

## Assumptions
- The conservatory roof leak and fence are not covered by any existing job.

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** I need new tickets for the fence and the conservatory roof leak, with the roof being urgent. The oven closure looks suspicious since there's no provider confirmation and the tenant hasn't verified the fix, so I should flag that too rather than trust the agency's claim. I'll create tickets: routine fence repair, urgent conservatory roof leak, and one to get tenant confirmation on the oven.
