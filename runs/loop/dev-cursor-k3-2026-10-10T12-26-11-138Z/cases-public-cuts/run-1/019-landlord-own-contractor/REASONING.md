# Case 019-landlord-own-contractor: REASONING

Toolset: local mock environment (no organiser API configured).

## What the system received
- Case details from `index.md`, with the task and questions (1595 chars)
- Cut point: history events 1–18 of 44 (events 19–44 withheld)
- `history.md` (5,139 bytes, 5,094 chars parsed): built by the loader; events 1–18 of 44 from history.md
- Referenced in the history but not provided: none

**Withheld from the agent:**
- `index.md`: sections that reveal the ending: Overview, Outcome, Next action at escalation, History, Attachments
- `rubric.json`: grading or test-harness file, never shown to the agent

The exact prompt text is in `TRANSCRIPT.md`.

## Conflicts between sources
- Event 009 says the landlord approved the £500+VAT quote, but the ticket shows approval required and later notes say we are waiting for the landlord. I treated it as unapproved.
- Notes mention both Harbour Compliance and 'Oakley's contractor' (possibly the landlord's own contractor).

## Assumptions
- The approval request went through the landlord record's channel; no SMS route is visible, so the second-channel chase is by phone on the follow-up date.

3. 💭 **Thinking (summary):** There's a conflict here—the note claims the landlord approved a £500+VAT quote from Harbour Compliance, which seems odd for a garden job, yet other holds mention getting funds up front, waiting on Jenkins to call back, and Oakley's contractor, with no actual recorded landlord decision tied to quotes. Since the ticket requires approval, I should reach out to the landlord with one clear question via a different channel like SMS, keep it on hold with a review date, and update the tenant—noting the landlord was already chased once by email on 8 Feb.
